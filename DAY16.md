Summary

Today, I focused on basic image preprocessing steps using OpenCV in Python, including converting an image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, and detecting edges with the Canny edge detector.

Detailed Steps

Read the Image: I started by importing the necessary libraries and reading the image from a file.
Convert the Image to Grayscale: The image was then converted from BGR color space to grayscale.
Apply Gaussian Blur: I applied Gaussian blur to the grayscale image to reduce noise and detail.
Detect Edges using the Canny Edge Detector: Edges were detected in the blurred image using the Canny edge detector.
Display the Results: Finally, the original image, grayscale image, and edge-detected image were displayed using matplotlib.
Results

The original image was successfully converted to grayscale, smoothed using Gaussian blur, and edges were detected using the Canny edge detector. The results were displayed using matplotlib.

Conclusion

Today's work on image preprocessing and edge detection using OpenCV-Python was successful. This exercise provided a clear understanding of basic image processing techniques essential for more complex computer vision tasks.

Future Steps

Next, I plan to explore object detection using Haar Cascades in OpenCV.
